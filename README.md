# This file has all the necessary code for a perceptual gamma-correction task.  

The light outputted from a computer display is not necessarily proportional to the value requested from the computer. This calibration process allows us to measure the light output as a function of the requested value. For computer displays, this relationship usually follows a power-law relationship (I= R^2, where I = Output intensity, R = requested signal and G (gamma) is determined for each individual display). The whole process is called gamma-correction.
